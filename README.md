# Collaborative Git Flow

There are many aspects of group work. This lesson will focus specifically  on using git and gitHub as a collaborative tool.

Git is the program that is used locally in your terminal for version control. In order to achevie this it uses `branches` and a process called `merging`.  GitHub mirrors a lot of the functionality of git, it also has the ability to branch and merge.  I think of git being a tool on my local machine used for version and gitHub being like facebook for my code.  

## Get organized

A little planning goes a long way!  Before initizizg a repo or writing any code it is beneficial to come together as a group and establish a few things:

- Determine who likes to work on which aspects of the code.  Some of us are more front end oriented some are more back end.  One of the benefits of working in a group is leaning on eachothers' skills AND learning from eachother.  Each person in the group should have a high level understanding of what each member is doing with their code even though they may not be working on that specific part.

- Agree upon a basic file structure.  As we code more and more projects we may find ourselves repeating a lot of the same tasks or setup.  This is another thing to lean into.  From the cullinary world there is an idea called *mise en place* which essentially means *putting everything in it's place*.  When we are consistant about how we set things up from project to project it will help us build muscle memory and allow us to focus on the project itself.  The opposite of this may bee seen as re-inventing the wheel each time  

- Determine who will initilize the repo.  While each person will eventually be a collaborator, one group member will set up the initial repo and then make others collaborators.  Each team member will clone the project to their local machine.


## Initilize a repo

Navigate to your gitHub account online.  In the top right hand corner there is a `+` button.  This will open a drop down menu, select new repository.

Fill out the form to create a new repo:
- Name
- Description of the repo (optional but reccomended)
- Add README (for sure!)
- Add .gitignore based on your project template (if available)

Click the green `Create repository` button
